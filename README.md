# AntennaRange
Supports a Web-based portal to operate and analyze antenna measurements

This appears to be the notes and code used to setup the web server
part of this service.  I don't know why they made it a separate branch
from the rest of the service files.  Pain in the ass, if you ask me.

## Working notes
