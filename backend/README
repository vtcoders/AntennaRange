What are the files in this directory?

  The AntennaRange software project requires at least one web server.
  At the time this was being developed the Ubuntu 20.04 operating system
  had a BUG in the deb (APT system) "apache2" package.  The httpd, web
  server program installed as /usr/sbin/apache2 as installed with 'apt
  install apache2' would not run, with a linker/loader error:

     /usr/sbin/apache2: symbol lookup error: /usr/sbin/apache2: undefined symbol: apr_os_uuid_get

   One of these two libraries: /usr/local/lib/libapr-1.so.0
   /usr/local/lib/libaprutil-1.so.0 should have apr_os_uuid_get in it, and
   neither did (Jul 16 2020).  So there is no way /usr/sbin/apache2 is going
   to load and run.

   We decided to build and install the apache2 httpd program from sources.
   It builds and installs relatively quickly and does not have a great
   number of dependences, that would tend to make this server brake over
   the long time (like libBOOST etc).



FILES

  The following bash scripts download, build, and install the package that
  the name of the script suggests.  You need to read, edit (prefix and
  stuff), and understand these scripts if you need to run them.  The
  scripts are quite short.  The openssl and nghttp2 were needed because
  the apache_http script installed a very new version of the apache2 web
  server.  The tagged versions of the packages are in the scripts.  If you
  change, up-grade, the versions you should check-in the scripts.  Running
  these scripts will generate files in this directory.  Please do not
  check-in these downloaded and/or generated files.


     openssl       -- installs openssl

     nghttp2       -- installs nghttp2

     apache_http   -- installs apache2

     githubGet     -- contains a helper function used by apache_http


  apache2/

    This directory, apache2/, contains the starting apache2 root directory
    with apache configuration files.  If you have no files in your apache2
    root directory than you could just recursively copy this directory to
    your apache2 web server root directory.  The file
    apache2/conf/httpd.conf may need to be edited to reflect what the
    apache2 root directory is, something like /usr/local/apache2
